              "'I m not sure why they don t refer to this Waterpik with its model number, WP-100. That s what it is. (they ve since changed the name from  professional  to WP-100)I have used Waterpiks over the years, and finally broke down an bought another after years of doing without. As far as their usefulness as a dental device, I think they re great. My dentist doesn t think that highly of them, but after paying him $5000 for dental surgery, maybe he just wants to assure himself of continued business.I don t floss much, and I m not that dedicated toothbrusher either. So when I use the pik, and there are always some food particles dislodged by it, even after flossing, I figure it must be doing some good.As far as this model goes, it works as expected, but I don tr find any improvments over the model I had 30 years ago. From the picture it looks bigger. So it has a smaller footprint than I expected, but the reservoir is also quite small. It s just big enough for a cursory cleaning without having to refill it.The pressure is quite a bit lower than older models. I don t know if there is a legitmate reason for having a lower pressure, or if it s a matter manufacturing costs. I d like a stronger jet for my preferences.The hose that connects the handle is way too short. You really need to keep the unit right next to the edge of the sink, and bend over. Again, I find no reason to do this except cost savings.Noeveral tips (30 years ago, there was only one flavor). Tounge cleaner, pick pocket, orthodontic tip, and plain vanilla. I can t say that any of the new designs adds anything to the operation.I hardly would call this unit  professional . It feels like it will have a limited life, and is hardly what I would call robust. I think a more apt description would be  Compact Basic .update 12/2/2006:Older WaterPiks used to have pressure fit tips (and worked fine). This has a button on the handle to release the tip, and it is located right where your thumb would be when holding it. The tip is constantly popping out because of this design flaw. With the short hose, 16oz capacity, weak pressure, my disappointment with this unit is only growing. I wish I could find a 25 year old model which had none of these problems.update 01/10/2007 - If I could, I d reduce my rating of this unit to 1 star. The designers must have been on vacation when they released this thing. The handle has a knurled collar, which you d think could be used to rotate the tip, but it doesn t. The tips are not keyed, so they won t necessarily turn when you rotate the collar. As I said, the release button for the tips is in a place where it s easy to press inadvertently. You can t turn the unit off and on with one hand due to its light weight. The hose is too short. The reservoir cover holds the extra tips, and is not convenient, nor do I trust it to keep the reservoir protected from ambient germs or bacteria. I really wish I could find one of the old models, which had none of these problems, so I could toss this one in the trash. Don t waste the extra money on this one, or if you have a old broken one, get it repaired instead of buying this thing.WP-100 Waterpik - Not what they used to be...'"

I use a tissue to remove all the excess mascara from the brush, apply what s left, and then the result is very nice.

The foundation is hard to put on.  If I am not careful I end up looking streaky.  My skin has a constant shine to it even after applying the foundation.  It has not helped with my oily skin.

At first I thought it was because I was pressing hard on my face with it, but in reality it s just too abrasive on my face. I am having the worst breakouts of my life due to this product. It s very scratchy on the skin and my skin gets really red and burns especially after I apply an alcohol free toner. This product is definitely for deep deep pores, something I guess I don t have.
